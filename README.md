This project build for learning purpose only and originally this project was built by Clever Programmer. \
If you try to open project on chrome or safari broweser, it shows website is unsafe because browser can detect that it's not the original website and fake websites was mostly using phishing attacks. \
Just click on Details and then click visit is unsafe site.

## About Project
For front-end react was used.\
For hosting, database, and backend deployment firebase was used.\
Firebase firestore(real-time) database is used to store all data .\
Backend was created using firebase cloud functions and nodejs was used to create it.\
For Payment processing , stripe is used that provides payment gateway for they project.\

## Functionalities in the project 
You can sign up and login using your account as well as login with google account.\
You can add items to the cart.\
You can go to cart, from their you can remove the items you wish to remove and also go for checkout.\
When  you go to checkout page, stripe api is used that generated a payment for order total and returns with it and asks for card details.\
Address for order is hard coded for now, you need to add credit card details to checkout.\
In card details just keep entering 42424242424242....... in all three fields.\
Then click on buy now.\

As stripe developer api was used  , so it doesn't ask for otp for payment it complete the transaction and return the payment id to react.\



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
